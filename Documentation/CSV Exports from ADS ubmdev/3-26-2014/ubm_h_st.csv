Credit representatives, when speaking with a delinquent account, should observe a few tips or principles.  -	Identify yourself and the Company and state the reason for calling.  Be direct and use a controlled, confident voice.  Concentrate on listening to the customer and don’t rush through the call. -	Get the facts – The most powerful tool is knowledge.  During the phone conversation, try to gain as much insight into the situation as possible.  Remember, the goals and objectives are to:  Collect the money, Identify reasons for non-payment, Settle on an agreement for clearing the debt, including special payment plans and exact dates when a check will be sent -	Never argue, accuse or be condescending – Verbally fighting or talking down to the customer will only serve to produce negative feelings and may hamper the collection effort.  The ultimate purpose is to secure payment, and this is best accomplished without becoming defensive or irriated. -	There are several common objections, complaints and excuses used to elude payment.  Study the following examples, to learn the most effective responses to the most frequently used ploys. -	“I didn’t get the invoice” – Respond by verifying the debtor’s name and address, and then review the account information with them. -	“The check is in the mail.” – Extend your thanks, and then ask for a check number, amount, date posted and address to which it was mailed. -	“Your payment is being processed.” – Ask when the payment will be ready for the mail.  Determine the process that the payment undergoes after if leaves your contact’s desk. -	“The computer is down” – When do you expect it to be up?  Can we get a manual payment? -	“I’ll pay you when we get paid”. – Respond calmly, but make a direct request for payment, such as When can I expect payment?” -	“I have no money”. – Create a payment plan, be flexible and consider the alternatives offered by the customer.  Work toward making the plan acceptable to both of you. ";183;1;0;0;0;0;0;1883;3312;0;"2014-01-30 11:56:31.551";3312;0;"2014-02-17 19:49:44.772";0;0;"";"";216

Once all bank statement items have been found and clicked off on the screen, the remaining ""un-cleared"" entries on the screen are, in effect, the list of outstanding checks and deposits in transit. Furthermore, the screen typically provides a continually updating reconciled cash amount that should agree to the ending bank balance amount once all items are correctly accounted for and cleared.  Usually the accounting system does the math and the screen displays both the ending bank balance and the reconciled cash amount with the remaining difference, if any.

The obvious first step is to make sure that all checks and deposits on the bank statement agree with the entries in the cash account.  Discrepancies of this type are usually rare in computerized environments but may be caused by improperly recording manual checks or credit card deposits and fees.   Checks are generally posted and printed simultaneously so that what shows up in the accounting system will always agree to what was processed through the bank.  Deposits are another matter.  The bank might group deposited checks differently than they were in the accounting system.   To simplify the month end reconciliation, receipts should be batched in a total deposit amount that agrees to both the accounting system and the bank. Make sure to print a totaled deposit report when daily receipts of checks and cash are batched for deposit.  After making the bank deposit, staple the validated bank deposit slip to the deposit report.  This will document the two events: 1) what was deposited per the accounting system, and 2) what was actually deposited in the bank.  These two amounts must agree. This helps eliminate deposit errors for check and cash receipts ";183;1;0;0;0;0;0;1927;3312;0;"2014-01-30 12:57:03.445";3312;0;"2014-02-17 19:49:44.774";0;0;"";"";255

The difficulty results from three uniq";"A more difficult reconciling task is in obtaining agreement of all credit card receipts.  The difficulty results from three unique situations.  First, there is a time lag of several days between the time the credit card transaction occurred in the store and the time it is settled or deposited to the store's bank account.  Second, depending on the type of credit card and/or the merchant provider, the fee charged (typically 1% to 4%) on each transaction may be automatically deducted from the deposit before it shows up on the bank statement.  And third, “chargebacks” are usually deducted immediately by the processor and only reversed if the dispute is resolved in the company’s favor.  This may even occur before the chargeback notice has arrived in the mail. Consequently, the deposit on the bank statement may not agree with the daily credit card batch (receipts).  In the face of these difficulties, the CFO and Controller should thoroughly understand the particular credit card daily closing procedures.  An end of day report for each credit card closing should be printed and saved as a reference for the month end reconciliation process. Alternatively, the credit card processor will provide a month-end statement listing each credit card “batch” submitted each day.  This report can be used to reconcile the credit card batches to the settlement deposits ";183;1;0;0;0;0;0;1928;3312;0;"2014-01-30 12:57:30.212";3312;0;"2014-02-17 19:49:44.774";0;0;"";"";256

The questions asked in the interview (see HRG104 Ex1 EMPLOYMENT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS) should address the candidates qualifications focusing on three criteria for selection: •	Longevity.  People tend to repeat past behaviors.  Candidates that remain in a job or at a company for years may be stable individuals and might indicate that the company will have time to earn a decent return.  Delve into areas where the candidate has spent more than three years in a single position without promotion.  Identify the reasons for leaving the last company. •	Career Progression.    A persons motivations, goals, and limitations can be identified through their progression through the ranks.  Ask the candidate to explain their career progression, to identify differences between lateral and vertical assignments, and to describe how they changed to adapt to the changing needs of their previous employer. •	Technical skills.  People tend to list a lot of skills implying proficiency that may not have been obtained.  Ask candidates to explain their technical strengths and weaknesses using a ranking for each skill listed.
